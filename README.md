Market Basket Optimization using Apriori Algorithm

Overview

This project demonstrates Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori Algorithm to identify frequent itemsets and generate association rules from transactional data. It helps understand customer purchasing behavior and discover relationships between products.

Objective

To analyze transaction data and find meaningful product associations such as
“If a customer buys item A, they are likely to buy item B.”
